# python-challenge
##Description:
In "PyBank", a financial dataset was given in a csv file and the task was to analyze the records to calculate and output the values: total number of months, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses", average changes, the greatest increase in profit, and the greatest decrease in profit. 

In "PyPoll," a Python script was needed to analyze the votes in a csv file and output an analysis of the list of candidates, the percentage of votes each received, the number of votes each received, and the winner of the election.

##Code:
The Python script utilized different functions such as import, csvreader, counterdict, and also used with and for loops to carry out the necessary analyses. 

##Acknowledgements:
These Python scripts were written with help from the UCB Bootcamp instructional staff, peers from the Slack channel, and the Learning Assistant.
